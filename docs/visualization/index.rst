Visualization (`sisl.viz`)
--------------------------

This is a full visualization framework developed specifically for ``sisl`` to visualize
all the processing that you can do with the package. The aim is to provide a **high-level API**
to generate plots through sisl, so that you can avoid **boilerplate code** and the iteration loop
with your results can be as fast as possible.

The plots that you can generate with it are **not bound to a specific visualization framework**. Instead, the users
can choose the one that they want based on their taste or on what is available in their environment. Currently,
there is support for visualizing the plots with `plotly`_, `matplotlib`_, `blender <https://www.blender.org/>`_. The flexibility of the framework
allows for the user to **extend the visualizing options** quite simply without modifying ``sisl``'s internal code.

The framework started as a GUI, but then evolved to make it usable by ``sisl`` users directly. Therefore,
it can serve as a very robust (highly tested) and feature full **backend to integrate visualizations into graphical interfaces**.
An example of this is `the sisl-gui package <https://pypi.org/project/sisl-gui/>`_.

Basic Tutorials

Showcase of plot classes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following notebooks will help you develop a deeper understanding of what each plot class is capable of.

Using it with blender
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The sisl visualization framework is independent of the plotting backend used, but `blender <https://www.blender.org/>`_ is a special one. Therefore
we dedicate this section to it with the hope of making the usage of it less confusing.

Combining plots
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Have two plots that you would like to see displayed together, maybe as an animation or subplots? You've come
to the right place!

Do it yourself
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Whether you feel like you would like to customize the framework a bit to fit your needs, you are a `sisl`
developer or you are building a framework (e.g. GUI) around `sisl.viz`, this is your section!
