.. module:: sisl.geom

The `~sisl.Geometry` class is the workhorse of basically
all computational details of large parts of `sisl`.
It defines atomic species, coordinates, associated orbitals
and much more. Therefore an extended suite of tools and methods
are available to handle this complex object.
