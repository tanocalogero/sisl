.. _geom-create:

Creating geometries
===================

.. currentmodule:: sisl.geom

A selection of default geometries that `sisl` can construct on the fly.

While this is far from complete we encourage users to contribute additional
geometries via a `pull request <pr>`_.

All methods returns a `~sisl.Geometry` object.

Some of the geometries are created in section based geometries, such as `heteroribbon`.
This functionality is provided through the `composite_geometry`.
