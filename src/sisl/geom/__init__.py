They generally take a lattice-parameter argument, and will all allow
to pass an ``atoms`` argument to pre-fill the atomic species for the
returned geometry:

  >>> graphene = si.geom.graphene(1.42, # bond-length
  ...               atoms=si.Atom('C',
  ...                       orbitals=si.AtomicOrbital("pz"))
  ... )
